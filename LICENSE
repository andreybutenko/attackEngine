To make my life easier, I'm not going to tell you about Apache or Creative Commons. Use this code wherever and however, but link to the Github page somewhere the users can access if you use a decent amount, whether it be a .txt file or an about window. I'm not going to define "decent amount," but I'm trusting you to be a good person
